Responsive Layout Using Grid Area

**grid-template-areas** is a property in CSS that allows you to define the placement of grid items using named grid areas. This can be useful for creating complex layouts and positioning items within a grid.

Here are some reasons why you might want to use grid-template-areas:

Creating a visual layout: By defining named areas within a grid, you can create a visual layout that's easier to understand and maintain. You can give each area a name that corresponds to its content, making it easier to identify and update.

Positioning items: With grid-template-areas, you can position grid items in specific areas of the grid. This gives you more control over the layout of your content and can help you achieve a more precise design.

Reordering items: Using named grid areas, you can easily reorder items within the grid by changing their placement. This makes it easier to experiment with different layouts and find the one that works best for your content.

Overall, grid-template-areas is a powerful tool for creating complex grid layouts and positioning items within them. If you're working with CSS grids, it's definitely worth exploring.
grid-template-areas and grid-area are two related CSS properties that can be used together to define a grid layout.

grid-template-areas is used to define the names of areas within the grid. Each area is represented as a string of characters, where each character corresponds to a grid cell. The characters can be any non-whitespace character, and they should be separated by spaces or line breaks. For example:

.grid {

  display: grid;
  
  grid-template-areas:
  
    "header header header"
    
    "nav main main"
    
    "nav footer footer";
    
}

In this example, we define a 3x3 grid with three named areas: "header", "nav", and "footer". The cells in the first row are all named "header", the cells in the second row are named "nav" and "main", and the cells in the third row are named "nav" and "footer".

Once you have defined the grid areas using grid-template-areas, you can use the grid-area property to place items into those areas. The grid-area property takes the name of the area as its value, and it can be applied to any grid item. For example:

.item-a {
  grid-area: header;
}

.item-b {
  grid-area: main;
}

.item-c {
  grid-area: footer;
}

In this example, we use grid-area to place three items into the areas we defined earlier: item-a goes in the "header" area, item-b goes in the "main" area, and item-c goes in the "footer" area.

By using grid-template-areas and grid-area together, you can create complex grid layouts with named areas that are easy to understand and maintain.
